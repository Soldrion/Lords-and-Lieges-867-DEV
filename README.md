# Lords-and-Lieges-867-DEV

This will have most of the work put into it, as it's the actual GAME game part.

For the 867 AD gamemode (dev).

Q/A:

Q: Why not make this a separate branch on the Lords & Lieges repo? 
A: Because I'm too dumb to sandbox the two on Roblox Studio and VS Code, so when i edit, edits apply to both the main version and this.

Q:Why no normal 867 AD branch? 
A: It's not necessary at the moment, as everything on the normal version will be pushed from the dev version anyways.

Q: Why open source your Roblox game? Isn't that something that kills games?
A: What normally kills Roblox games is when they aren't copy-locked. This allows anyone to just make a copy with no effort, with everything how it is in the game, very much like forking a project.
My game's source code is available, and I encourage anyone to look inside and suggest and contribute whatever they feel would better the game. 
Anyone can use my scripts, and if someone wants to make a spinoff game they can. They cannot, however, copy the likeness and/or 100% source code of my game and claim the idea as their own.
